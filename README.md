## Overview

This is a Face Recognition and Privacy Analysis Tool, a software application developed with the primary goal of providing face and object recognition capabilities. While its current focus is on recognizing faces and objects in various media elements, including images, videos, and documents, its long-term vision includes becoming a powerful privacy analysis tool. The inspiration for this tool is the growing concern regarding data privacy and the potential misuse of facial recognition technology.

## Features

### Face and Object Recognition

Our application boasts a user-friendly interface and combines simplicity with powerful features. At its core, this software excels in providing robust face and object detection capabilities. Users can use its potential to thoroughly analyze various media elements, enabling them to identify and work with faces and objects. Additionally, the application aims to offer a rich array of features, including in-app editing, downloading, and screen-time score.


### Data Privacy Analysis (Upcoming)

In the future, we plan to expand the application's functionality to include data privacy analysis. Our vision is to empower users to understand how much information can be associated with the faces and objects detected in various media elements. This feature is aimed at individuals, organizations, and researchers seeking to evaluate privacy risks and compliance.

### Integration with External APIs (Upcoming)

To enhance the privacy analysis capabilities, we intend to integrate the application with external APIs such as Google's Vision API and SerpAPI. These APIs will enable us to scrape the internet for relevant data linked to the detected faces and objects, ensuring that users receive comprehensive and up-to-date information.

## Goals

Our application has two primary goals:

1. **Detailed Analysis**: To provide a detailed analysis of faces and objects detected in media elements like images, videos, and documents. This feature is designed to cater to a wide range of users, from professionals in the field to those seeking a user-friendly tool for face and object detection.

2. **Data Privacy**: To address data privacy concerns related to facial recognition and data mining. By analyzing the data linked to the detected faces and objects, the application aims to shed light on privacy implications, enabling users to make informed decisions regarding data sharing and consent.

## Future Direction

Our vision for the application extends beyond face recognition. We aim to build a comprehensive privacy analysis tool that informs users about the safety of their information and quantifies the extent to which their data is available online. The motivation behind this tool is to highlight the potential risks of data collection and misuse, which can have harmful consequences if employed for unethical purposes. By providing source links and URLs related to public data, our goal is to empower users to make informed decisions about how and where their personal data is exposed.

## Contribution

We welcome contributions from developers and anyone interested in enhancing this application. Feel free to fork the repository, submit pull requests, or open issues to help us improve the tool and achieve its objectives.

Thank you for your interest in the Face Recognition and Privacy Analysis Tool. Together, we can make a difference in understanding and addressing data privacy issues related to facial recognition.

## Dependencies

The application relies on several key dependencies to function effectively:

- **OpenCV**: An open-source computer vision and machine learning software library that provides essential tools for image and video analysis.

- **wxWidgets**: A powerful C++ library for creating native graphical user interfaces (GUIs) across multiple platforms.

- **C++**: The core programming language used for developing the application.
