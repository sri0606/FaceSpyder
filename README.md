## Overview

This is a Face Recognition and Privacy Analysis Tool, a software application developed with the primary goal of providing face and object recognition capabilities. While its current focus is on recognizing faces and objects in various media elements, including images and videos, its long-term vision includes becoming a powerful privacy analysis tool. The inspiration for this tool is the growing concern regarding data privacy and the potential misuse of facial recognition technology.

In its current iteration, the application can identify and recognizes faces in both images and videos, offering users the capability to save these detected faces for further analysis. As we progress, our vision is to evolve and expand this foundational version. Our goal is to enhance its functionalities significantly, cementing its role as a robust tool for privacy analysis.

## Future Directions and Goals

Our vision for the application extends beyond face recognition. We aim to build a comprehensive privacy analysis tool that informs users about the safety of their information and quantifies the extent to which their data is available online. The motivation behind this tool is to highlight the potential risks of data collection and misuse, which can have harmful consequences if employed for unethical purposes. By providing source links and URLs related to public data, our goal is to empower users to make informed decisions about how and where their personal data is exposed.

Our application has two primary goals:

1. **Detailed Analysis**: To enhance the privacy analysis capabilities, we intend to integrate the application with external APIs such as Google's Vision API and SerpAPI. These APIs will enable us to scrape the internet for relevant data linked to the detected faces and objects, ensuring that users receive comprehensive and up-to-date information.

2. **Data Privacy**: To address data privacy concerns related to facial recognition and data mining. By analyzing the data linked to the detected faces and objects, the application aims to shed light on privacy implications, enabling users to make informed decisions regarding data sharing and consent.

## Contribution

We welcome contributions from developers and anyone interested in enhancing this application. Feel free to fork the repository, submit pull requests, or open issues to help us improve the tool and achieve its objectives.

Thank you for your interest in the Face Recognition and Privacy Analysis Tool. Together, we can make a difference in understanding and addressing data privacy issues related to facial recognition.
